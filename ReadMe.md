# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Reduce Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Reduce Plugin performs calculations appearing on other pages while collecting results into a summary. A slider allows one to vary one or more parameters while viewing the impact these have on the outcomes.
